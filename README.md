## Install

### [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@procedure-rpc/signals "npm is a package manager for JavaScript")
`npm install --save @procedure-rpc/signals`

## Usage

### AggregateSignal
Combines several `AbortSignal` instances into a signal which will be aborted as soon as any of the underlying signals are.

```js
const { AggregateSignal } = require('@procedure-rpc/signals');

const ac = new AbortController();
const aggregateSignal = new AggregateSignal(ac.signal, someOtherSignal);

// passing an aggregate signal into an awaitable, abortable call:
await doSomeAbortableAction({ signal: aggregateSignal.signal });

// determining which of the original signals was aborted first:
switch (aggregateSignal.abortedSignal) {
    case ac.signal:
        // do stuff
        break;
    // etc...
}
```

### TimeoutSignal
Creates an `AbortSignal` which will automatically timeout after a given number of milliseconds. Based on native `timeout`.

```js
const { TimeoutSignal } = require('@procedure-rpc/signals');

const timeoutSignal = new TimeoutSignal(200); // creates an AbortSignal which will abort in 200ms

// passing a timeout signal into an awaitable, abortable call:
await doSomeAbortableAction({ signal: timeoutSignal.signal });

// If for whatever reason you need to clear the underlying timeout of the TimeoutSignal, you can:
clearTimeout(timeoutSignal.timeout);
```

### isAbortSignal
A TypeScript type guard for checking whether a given object is an `AbortSignal`.

```ts
import { isAbortSignal } from '@procedure-rpc/signals';

if (isAbortSignal(someObject)) {
    // within this block, someObject is typed as an AbortSignal
    console.log(someObejct.aborted);
}
```

### isSignal
A TypeScript type guard for checking whether a given object is an `AbortSignal` *and* conforms to a minimal `EventTarget` interface. Useful for when TypeScript hates us (i.e. does not yet have support for `AbortSignal`'s `EventTarget` interface).

```ts
import { isSignal } from '@procedure-rpc/signals';

if (isSignal(someObject)) {
    // within this block, someObject is typed as a Signal (which extends AbortSignal)
    someObject.addEventListener('abort', () => {
        // ...
    });
}
```
